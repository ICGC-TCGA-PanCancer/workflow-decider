A tool for identifying samples ready for alignment, scheduling on clusters, and monitoring for completion.

=head1 NAME

Workflow Decider - SeqWare

=back

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=over

=item --cluster-json[=][ ]<cluster_json>

JSON file that describes the clusters available to schedule workflows to. Should be located in the config folder.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item --gnos-url[=][ ]<gnos_url>

URL for a GNOS server, e.g. https://gtrepo-ebi.annailas.com

=for Euclid 
   gnos_url.default: 'https://gtrepo-ebi.annailabs.com'

=item --working-dir[=][ ]<working_directory>

A place for temporary ini and settings files

=for Euclid
    working_directory.default: 'decider_tmp'

=item --sample[=][ ]<sample_uuid>

For only running one particular sample based on its uuid

=item --threads[=][ ]<thread_count>

Number of threads to use for BWA

=for Euclid
   thread_count.default: 8

=item --test

Indicates no workflow should be scheduled, just summary of what would have been run.

=item --ignore-lane-count

Skip the check that the GNOS XML contains a count of lanes for this sample and the bams count matches

=item --force-run

Schedule workflows even if they were previously completed

=item --skip-meta-download

Use the previously downloaded XML from GNOS (only useful for testing).

=item --report[=][ ]<report_file>

The report file name that the results will be placed in by the decider

=for Euclid
   report_file.default: 'workflow_decider_report.txt'

=item --settings[=][ ]<seqware_settings>

The template seqware settings file

=for Euclid
   seqware_settings.default: 'seqware.setting'

=item --upload-results

A flag indicating the resulting BAM files and metadata should be uploaded to GNOS, default is to not upload!!!

=item --ignore-failed 

A flag indicating that previously failed runs for this specimen should be ignored and the specimen scheduled again

=item --skip-cached

A flag indicating that previously download metadata XML files should not be downloaded again

=item --skip-gtdownload

A flag indicating that input files should be just the bam input paths and not from GNOS

=item --skip-gtupload

A flag indicating that upload should not take place but output files should be placed in output_prefix/output_dir

=item --output-prefix[=][ ]<output_prefix>

If --skip-gtupload is set, use this to specify the prefix of where output files are written

=for Euclid
    output_prefix.default: './'

=item --output-dir[=][ ]<output_directory>

if --skip-gtupload is set, use this to specify the dir of where output files are written

=for Euclid
   output_directory.default: 'seqware-results/'

=item --input-prefix[=][ ]<prefix>

if --skip-gtdownload is set, this is the input bam file prefix
