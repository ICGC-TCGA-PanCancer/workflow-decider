.TH FASTQTOBAM 1 "July 2013" BIOBAMBAM
.SH NAME
fastqtobam - convert FastQ to unmapped BAM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B fastqtobam
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
fastqtobam reads one or two FastQ files and converts them to a BAM file in
which each read is marked as unmapped. If no input file name is given, then
a single FastQ file is read from standard input. If one file name is given,
then a single FastQ file is read from the given file. In both cases the read
names in the file are parsed to determine whether the contained reads are
paired or not. If two file names are given, then the program assumes to find
two FastQ files which are synchronous, i.e. where the first read in the
first file is the mate of the first read in the second file etc. Input file
names can be given either via the I key or after the key=value pairs on the
command line.
.PP
The following key=value pairs can be given:
.PP
.B verbose=<[0|1]>
print progress report. By default progress is not reported.
.PP
.B I=<filename>: 
input file name (data is read from standard input if this option is not given). This key can be given twice.
.PP
.B level=<-1|0|1|9>:
set compression level of the output BAM file. Valid
values are
.IP -1:
zlib/gzip default compression level
.IP 0:
uncompressed
.IP 1:
zlib/gzip level 1 (fast) compression
.IP 9:
zlib/gzip level 9 (best) compression
.PP
.B md5=<0|1>:
md5 checksum creation for output file. Valid values are
.IP 0:
do not compute checksum. This is the default.
.IP 1:
compute checksum. If the md5filename key is set, then the checksum is
written to the given file. If md5filename is unset, then no checksum will be computed.
.PP
.B md5filename
file name for md5 checksum if md5=1.
.PP
.B gz=<[0|1]>
input is gzip compressed FastQ. By default input is assumed to be uncompressed FastQ.
.PP
.B threads=<1>
additional BAM encoding helper threads.
.PP
.B PGID=<>
read group identifier for reads. By default no read group identifer is set.
The fields CN, DS, DT, FO, KS, LB, PG, PI, PL, PU and SM of the
corresponding @RG header line can be set by using the keys RGCN, RGDS, etc.
respectively.
