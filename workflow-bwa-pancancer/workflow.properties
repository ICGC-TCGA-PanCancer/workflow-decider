workflow-description=This is the SeqWare BWA-Mem PanCancer Workflow version 2.4.0 available in its packaged form from https://s3.amazonaws.com/oicr.workflow.bundles/released-bundles/Workflow_Bundle_BWA_2.4.0_SeqWare_1.0.13.zip.  This workflow can be created from source, see https://github.com/SeqWare/public-workflows.  New features for this workflow compared to 2.3 include: 1) a gtdownload wrapper that monitors progress and kills and restarts the job if it freezes and 2) an option for skipping download/upload from/to GNOS and instead use local file paths (GNOS is still used to retrieve metadata).  Please note the reference is hs37d, see ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/phase2_reference_assembly_sequence/README_human_reference_20110707 for more information. Briefly this is the integrated reference sequence from the GRCh37 primary assembly (chromosomal plus unlocalized and unplaced contigs), the rCRS mitochondrial sequence (AC:NC_012920), Human herpesvirus 4 type 1 (AC:NC_007605) and the concatenated decoy sequences (hs37d5cs.fa.gz).
